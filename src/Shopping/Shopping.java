/*
Write a simple application that will simulate a shopping.
Use only if-else flow control. Consider following cases:
If you would like to buy a bottle of milk – cashier will ask you for a specific amount of money.
 You have to enter that value and verify if it is same as the cashier asked.
If you would like to buy a bottle of wine – cashier will ask you if you are
an adult and for positive answer ask for a specific amount of money.
